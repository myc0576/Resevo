# Experiment Closeout Workflow

Run this workflow at the end of every research task, including literature-only, figure-only, code-only, reconstruction, calibration, validation, and writing tasks.

## Closeout Questions

1. Goal alignment
   - Which research goal did this task serve?
   - Did it change the project route, assumption, or system design?
2. Evidence
   - What data, metric, residual, plot, log, or reproduction command exists?
   - Which claim and figure does it support or weaken?
   - What is still missing?
3. Reuse decision
   - Did this produce reusable knowledge?
   - Did this produce a reusable prompt?
   - Did this produce project research assets?
   - Did this require a decision record?
4. Registry update
   - Update `registry/papers.yaml` when a paper contract changes.
   - Update `registry/literature.yaml` when a literature card is created or revised.
   - Update `registry/figures.yaml` when a figure card or visual reference is created.
   - Update `registry/prompts.yaml` for reusable prompt cards.
   - Update `registry/decisions.yaml` for route, claim-boundary, or workflow decisions.

## Sink Rules

- Reusable knowledge goes to `G:\knowledge\reusable_knowledge\<category>`.
- Reusable prompts go to `G:\knowledge\reusable_prompts\<category>`.
- Project research assets go to the current project's `research_assets\YYYYMMDD_task_name`.
- Small-paper正文、图件、投稿文件 go to `G:\docs\小论文\<paper_id>` by default.
- ResearchLoop workflow rules, templates, registries, and decisions stay in `G:\BaiduSyncdisk\ResearchLoop`.
- ResearchLoop stores paper templates, workflows, indexes, registry cards, and decision records only; it is not the manuscript or submission package directory.
- Raw experiment data, PDFs, large binaries, and temporary intermediate outputs are not copied into knowledge.

## Status Discipline

- Use `validated` only when evidence exists and can be cited.
- Use `hypothesis` for plausible but unverified scientific statements.
- Use `pending validation` when evidence is planned, partial, or not yet reproduced.
- Keep paper-readiness and approval state human-controlled.
