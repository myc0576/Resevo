# Self-Evolution Loop Workflow

This workflow turns G drive closeout into a one-click loop. It is designed for
the trigger family `自进化`, `沉淀`, `更新`, `写回`, `复用`, `调用 harness`,
`closeout`, `loop`, and related phrases.

## Loop Contract

The loop is intentionally small:

```text
recall -> intake -> contract -> candidate writeback -> validation -> next bottleneck
```

- `recall`: search current reusable knowledge, prompts, assets, decisions, and
  backlog before creating new material.
- `intake`: the active Agent writes `templates/self_evolution_intake.yaml` from
  the current task context. The runner does not read chat history directly.
- `contract`: `scripts/self_evolution_loop.py run` copies the intake into
  `runs/YYYYMMDD/<run_id>/` and writes `contract.yaml`.
- `candidate writeback`: automatic writes are limited to `candidate` or
  `pending validation`. Human-only states such as `validated`, `reusable`,
  `approved`, `pass`, and `paper_ready` are never emitted automatically.
- `validation`: run registry and closeout checks after any writeback.
- `next bottleneck`: report the next missing evidence, weak rule, or review
  dependency so the next loop has a concrete target.

## Roles

- Planner: converts a user task into a bounded intake file and names evidence
  paths.
- Generator: runs the deterministic CLI and writes only canonical files.
- Evaluator: reads diffs, registry output, validator output, and trace files.

The same model may perform more than one role, but the artifacts must remain
separate: intake, contract, state, trace, written files, and validation reports.

## Restart Policy

Every run must be restorable from three files in the run directory:

- `contract.yaml`
- `state.json`
- `trace.jsonl`

If a session crashes, run:

```powershell
python G:\BaiduSyncdisk\ResearchLoop\scripts\self_evolution_loop.py resume --run-id <run_id> --json
```

`resume` must not duplicate registry entries. Completed runs are reported as
already complete.

## Candidate-First Policy

The runner may create:

- `G:\knowledge\reusable_knowledge\<category>\<id>.md` with status
  `pending validation`
- `G:\knowledge\reusable_prompts\<category>\<id>.md` with status
  `pending validation`
- `G:\projects\<project>\research_assets\<id>` with status `candidate`
- `G:\BaiduSyncdisk\ResearchLoop\decisions\<id>.md` with status
  `pending validation`
- `registry/workflow_improvement_backlog.yaml` entries with status
  `pending validation`

Promotion to `validated`, `reusable`, `approved`, `pass`, or `paper_ready`
requires explicit human review or a separate evidence-backed promotion gate.

## Trace Reading

The evaluator reads `trace.jsonl` before claiming completion. Useful trace
events include:

- `start`
- `recall`
- `validate_intake`
- `snapshot`
- `write_candidate`
- `skip_candidate`
- `validation_step`
- `complete`

If output looks wrong, search the trace for the first point where expected and
actual behavior diverged, then update the intake or runner rule for that exact
moment.

## Subjective Score Rubric

Subjective quality may be scored only when the rubric is written down:

| Axis | Weight | Question |
|---|---:|---|
| usefulness | 0.35 | Will this help a future related G drive task? |
| traceability | 0.25 | Are source paths, commands, and evidence clear? |
| boundary safety | 0.25 | Are claims conservative and statuses non-promoted? |
| retrieval fit | 0.15 | Will recall find this with likely trigger words? |

Scores are advisory. They do not promote candidate material by themselves.

## Trigger Table

Agents should activate recall or self-evolution when the user says any of:

`自进化`, `沉淀`, `更新`, `更新 harness`, `写回`, `写入 harness`, `知识库`,
`复用`, `资产化`, `候选资产`, `经验沉淀`, `closeout`, `harness closeout`,
`调用历史`, `查历史`, `参考之前`, `loop`, `一键 loop`, `retro`,
`写入知识库`, `更新知识库`, `同步 harness`, `沉淀到 harness`.

## Commands

```powershell
python scripts\self_evolution_loop.py recall --query "<task>" --project-root <cwd> --json
python scripts\self_evolution_loop.py init --project-root <cwd> --trigger "自进化" --out <intake.yaml>
python scripts\self_evolution_loop.py run --intake <intake.yaml> --apply-candidates --json
python scripts\self_evolution_loop.py resume --run-id <run_id> --json
```
